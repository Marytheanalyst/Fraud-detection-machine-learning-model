Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify fraudulent transactions and help in preventing financial losses due to fraudulent activities.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection datatest](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains a large number of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. It includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical features derived from the transaction.

Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install the dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Run the project:

Copy code
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py
This will train the logistic regression model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.

Results
The performance of the logistic regression model on the credit card fraud detection task can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions can be analyzed through these metrics and further improvements can be made if necessary.
